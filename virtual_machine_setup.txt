Windows Sandbox

 Setup a Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19045 Build 19045) virtual machine in VirtualBox 7.0 with only Local disk (C:)
 Install VirtualBox guestAdditions with \slash auto\_logon switch
 Create a VirtualBox vdi, attach it to the vm and initialize it as New Volume (E:) through disk management. This will act as personal files storage and PML logs storage within the vm.

 Install Python 3.11.0
 Install pip 22.3
 Install MalwareBazaar v0.1.2 through "pip install MalwareBazaar"
 Download and unzip Process Monitor v3.92 folder in the Windows downloads folder and rename it as "ProcessMonitor"
 Download and put the spade.reporter.ProcMon.pmc file in the ProcessMonitor folder
 Download and unzip densityscout\_build\_45\_windows folder in New Volume (E:)
 Download and unzip NapierOne Dataset and distribute the dataset files across the virtual machine.
 To turn off security features, go to Local Group Policy Editor -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components
 Now configure the following policies
 "Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus" -> enabled
 "Turn off routine remediation" -> enabled
 Go to "Scan" folder and configure the following policies
 "Turn archive files" -> disabled
 "Turn on heuristics" -> disabled
 "Scan packed executables" -> disabled
 "Turn on heuristics" -> disabled
 "Turn on heuristics" -> disabled
 Go back and now go to "Real-time Protection" folder and configure the following policies
 "Turn off real-time protection" -> enabled
 "Turn on behavior monitoring" -> disabled
 "Scan all downloaded files and attachments" -> disabled
 "Monitor file and program activity on your computer" -> disabled
 "Turn on raw volume write notifications" -> disabled
 "Turn on process scanning whenever real-time protection is enabled" -> disabled
 "Configure local setting override for turn on behavior monitoring" -> disabled 
 "Configure local setting override for scanning all downloaded files and attachments" -> disabled
 "Configure local setting override for monitoring file and program activity on your computer" -> disabled
 "Configure local setting override to turn on real-time protection" -> disabled
 "Configure local setting override for monitoring for incoming and outgoing file activity" -> disabled
  Turn off the vm, go to virtual media manager and make the vdi containing the Local Disk (C:) immutable 
  Take a snapshot of the virtual machine as "Snapshot1"
 Create another VirtualBox vdi named vm_logsDump.vdi in the repro folder and not in the default general vdi folder, attach it to the vm, and initialize it as New Volume (F:) through disk management. Then close the vm and restore it back to "Snapshot1". This vdi will act as a secondary drive where the PML logs will be transferred and then extracted into the host.


SPADE Processing

 Setup a Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS virtual machine in VirtualBox 7.0
 Install and setup SPADE in the home directory
 Go to startup applications preferences -> add "/home/spades/SPADE/bin/spade start" as the entry
 Copy the code from getFileOperations.py and then delete the file. Then create a file on desktop with the same name "getFileOperations.py", paste the code into that file and move that file into the shared folder.
 Turn off the virtual machine
 Take a snapshot of the virtual machine as "Snapshot1"
